They correspond to a single instrument power cycle so spectra collected within a single activity are relatively near each other in both space and time. Also, the spacecraft was generally oriented during an activity for a single observational purpose. Activities are numbered based on an incrementing counter that named UVS data files as they were created onboard the spacecraft. Most activities generated a single file, so activity numbers are approximately a count of the number of instrument power cycles. Occultation activities are the exception because they generated enough spectra to span two data files. Occultation activities, therefore, are assigned the number given to their first file, and no activity is assigned the number given to the second file, i.e., activity numbering skips one number after each occultation.","atm","ASCII_Integer","0","1","1","9223372036854775807","Unbounded","Unbounded","Units_of_None","none","TBD_classConcept","INTEGER"
